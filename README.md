# winners_way
Arcade battles (Snake, Stack Up and Word Seekers) in real-time! Play with real people and fill your "Way" with victories! Built with AS3 (client) and C# with noSQL (backend). Integrated with Facebook - play here: https://apps.facebook.com/winnersway

P.S. this game was created in 2011 - at times when I had only a surface knowledge of C# and its OOP capabilities. So you may find many things which could be done better (e.g. incredibly ingenious inheritance relationships in the "serverside" folder).
